<h2>About</h2>

<p>Hey, I'm Mattye. I enjoyed using Jekyll way more than I enjoyed using Harp, mostly
because I was able to get Jekyll to work with minimal hassle and I have not yet
been nearly as successful with Harp. Pretty much everything with Jekyll worked well,
and I enjoyed how easy it was to set up, add a theme to, and customize. I would
use Jekyll for future work or school assignments. If I need to make a quick and simple blog for a future
assignment, I will definitely consider using Jekyll to do so. I really enjoy how easy it is to set up and use,
while still being customizable.</p>
