<p>Last week, I picked up a female Tliltocatl Albopilosus (common name: Curly Hair Tarantula), whose name, I learned from
the guy selling her, is Curly. As it happened, I needed to pick her up on my way to Thompson Falls, MT. What follows is a bit of a photo spam detailing this event.</p>
<p>Here she is directly after pickup, hiding in the bottom of her substrate: </p>

<p><em>She was a bit skeptical of the safety of a moving car </em></p>

<p>I removed her water bowl and some of her cage rocks for transport, which she found utterly distasteful and, frankly, rude of me. I met with a friend once we arrived in Thompson Falls to drop off my dad's dog to be dogsit for a couple of weeks, and we met up at
a pizza place. Curly came inside with us because it was far too cold outside for a tarantula. Here she is considering the menu:</p>

<p><em>"They don't sell anything with crickets on it here!"</em></p>

<p>To make sure she didn't turn into a tarantula popsicle, she got a generous donation of my coat.</p>

<p><em>I think this development reassured the employees a little bit. They were shooting me concerned/mildly terrified glances</em></p>

<p>At that point, she deemed it safe to wander around and explore a little:</p>

<p>An assortment of quotes from resturant employees:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"You've got a cool spider!"</p></li>
<li><p>"Yeah I've never really liked...spiders..." (Hey, points for honesty)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Upon returning to the car, I realized I left the wax worms and crickets in there. Oops, sorry guys. (They were alive and no worse for wear).</p>

<p>And then we were headed home, off to warmer, cricket-abundant pastures.</p>

<p><em>"Finally, you guys turned off the lights! Don't you know that self-respecting tarantulas such as myself prefer the dark? Amateurs."</em></p>
