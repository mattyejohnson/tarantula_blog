<p><em>(Alright, their proper common name is Orange Baboon Tarantula, but Orange Bitey Thing is more accurate)</em></p>

Four things about OBTs:<br />
1. They can bite <br />
2. They will bite <br />
3. They <em>love</em> to bite <br />
4. Their bites can sometimes put you in the hospital

<p>Appealing? Maybe not. But if you're an experienced handler, consider this list as well:</p>

1. Some OBTs do a little happy murder dance after they kill their prey. It's adorable<br />
2. They look like *this*: <br /> ![curly1.jpg](/img/hannibal.jpg)<br />
3. They're so angry all the time, but in an endearing way, y'know?<br />
4. You can come up with fun reasons for their names that you can tell everyone that asks about them. 
Mine for the above tarantula is: His name is Hannibal, because he's medically significant (being eaten is somewhat medically significant, no?)<br />
